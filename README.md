# Learning cProfile

Let’s say you have an algorithm that takes a lot of time to run. 
And you want to reduce the code run time. The first question that might crop up is:

Why does my code take so long to run?

Python Profilers can answer that question. 
It tells you which part of the code took how long to run. 
This lets you focus on that particular part and achieve efficiency.
